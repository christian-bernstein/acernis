# acernis

Acernis is a node based command framework, able to handle large command trees without getting confusing and slow in execution time. 
It uses a pre-parameter-validation concept for consigning the correct arguments to the executors. The framework ships with premade validators and a internal permission system.

### Goals
  * Create a scalable environment for extensive command handling 
  * Provide a simple framework for node-based command creation
  * Process and validate parameters internally to make parameter validation by the executors itself redundend
  
### How to use
The system is designed to be as simple as possible, however the wiki provides a detailed work-through on all the capabilities of the framework.
